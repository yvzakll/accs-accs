AIFA CYBER SECURITY SYSTEM

AIFA CYBER SECURITY SYSTEM is a login key generator for our Windows RDP Guard Project. 

In this project, I created a listview and developed a structure that holds the data in it. Then I produced a login key by combining the auth key I held with the ref key entered by the user.
